# ChangeStreetAssignMent

To build the application just clone the project and run it.

Approach :

created custom layout file for each menu item.
pass the list of items to class SideMenuAnimator it will inflate the views and add it to linearlayout created in MainActivity layout.
OpenAnimation()  method will show the menu items with scale and flipanimation.
closeAnimation() method will hide the menu items with scale and flipanimation.
Note: I used both flip and scale animation to get similar experience that shown in the pinterest link.
If click on any menu item it will pass menuItem name through interface.we can see that through Toast.

Time taken to analyse and understand overall animation including cards : 30min  to  45min

Time taken to implement menu : 4hrs


I am not implemented cards. Because u mentioned in doc that focus on menu.If u have any further requirements or issues please let me know.
